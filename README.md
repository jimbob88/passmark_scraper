A ( for personal use only ) scraper for CPU + GPU data from passmark.com


## Warning
Due to changes in how `cpubenchmark.net/` renders tables, with their newer jQuery design this software is not being updated as it would require moving to `selenium` so as to be able to change jQuery tables columns so MEGA table support no longer works and the rest of the code is rather "iffy" with some values randomly breaking.
